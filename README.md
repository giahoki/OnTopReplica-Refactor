# OnTopReplica Refactor

**A real-time always-on-top "replica" of a window of your choice, for Windows Vista, 7, 8, 10, and 11.**

This simple utility application shows a blank always-on-top window by default. Users can pick any other window of the system to have an always up-to-date clone of the target window shown always-on-top. Very useful for monitoring background processes, wrangling with complex multi-window games or tools, watching YouTube videos while working, and so on.

This is an enhanced fork of the original [OnTopReplica by LorenzCK](https://github.com/LorenzCK/OnTopReplica), featuring .NET 4.8 migration, Windows 11 support, hotkeys, language selection, enhanced fullscreen modes, and more.

## 📢 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Clone any window** and keep it *always-on-top* while working with other windows
- **Select a subregion** of the cloned window:
  - Can be stored for future use
  - Can use relative coordinates from the target window's borders
- **Auto-resizing** — fit the original window, half, quarter, and fullscreen modes
- **Position lock** on any corner of your screen
- **Adjustable opacity** for transparent overlays

### Interaction
- **"Click forwarding"** — interact with the cloned window directly
- **"Click-through"** — makes the replica ignore any mouse interaction (turns OnTopReplica into an overlay when combined with partial opacity)
- **"Group switch" mode** — automatically switches through a group of windows while you use them

### New in Refactor ✨
- **⌨️ Global Hotkeys**
  - Configurable hotkey to show/hide OnTopReplica
  - Configurable hotkey to clone the currently focused window
  - Manage hotkeys in the Options panel

- **🌍 Multi-Language Support**
  - Choose from 12+ interface languages with flag icons
  - English, Čeština, Dansk, Deutsch, Español, Italiano, Polski, Русский, 简体中文, 繁體中文, Português, 日本語
  - Auto-detects system language by default

- **🖥️ Enhanced Fullscreen Modes**
  - **Standard** — fills the working area (excludes taskbar)
  - **Fullscreen** — covers the entire screen including taskbar
  - **All Screens** — spans across all connected monitors

- **🔧 Technical Improvements**
  - Migrated to **.NET Framework 4.8**
  - Updated to latest **WindowsFormsAero** library
  - **Windows 11** support
  - Removed auto-update system for cleaner, more stable builds
